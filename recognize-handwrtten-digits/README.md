## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous MNIST dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library. It consists of 8x8 images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

## Setup
To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
```sh
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

3. Run the Python script:
```sh
python handwritten_digit_recognition.py

```
## Description
'handwritten_digit_recognition.py': This Python script contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the MLP Classifier, plotting the loss curve, and making predictions.
